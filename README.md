# Student-Management-System

## Project Description
The Student Management System is a full-stack web application designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing student records. This project was developed with the aim of understanding the entire flow of a full-stack web application, focusing on the backend logic while utilizing Thymeleaf for the frontend.

## Features
- **Create:** Seamlessly create new student profiles with comprehensive details.
- **Read:** Easily access and retrieve student information through a user-friendly interface, allowing for quick and efficient data retrieval.
- **Update:** Effortlessly update student details ensuring accurate and up-to-date records.
- **Delete:** Securely remove student profiles from the system, ensuring proper data management and privacy.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Thymeleaf (It allowed me to focus more on the backend logic)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (It significantly reduces the time and effort required for configuration and setup), Hibernate (It simplifies the process of object-relational mapping (ORM) in Java applications)
- **Database:** MySQL(it offers a combination of reliability, scalability, and ease of use)
